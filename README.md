# ZoomCamp_Midterm_Project
## The aim of the project is to build a model that best predicts the amount of co2 emissions per capita in different countries.

Data from Kaggle was used to build various models (https://www.kaggle.com/code/atreyakatnam/co2-emission-prediction#DATA-ANALYSIS ). This data is loaded in the project itself from my repository. Two datasets were given on the web-site, and later they were combined for a larger sample of data.

**-notebook.ipynb** is a file with data preparation, EDA and training various models

**-train.py** is a file with the best model and testing this other model on other data
